## Numerical Continuation via pde2path
To run the files for continuation, you first have to download pde2path (see [https://pde2path.uol.de/index.html](https://pde2path.uol.de/index.html)) and load it into the current path in Matlab.

In the folder `pde2path continuation`, there are two folders. Both of them work in the same way so the process will be explained for the folder called `q=0.0196639` only.

We focus on continuing along one spatially homogeneous equilibria.

You can run the file `cmds2D.m` in order to obtain the continuation for this steady state.
